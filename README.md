# Eyebrow
> Minimalistic JavaScript single-page web framework

Eyebrow or just Brow is a minimal single-page web framework for front-end JavaScript inspired by Backbone and AngularJS. It is a simple View library which bundles together simple templating, view management, routing and data store in a very minimalistic way.

## Installation
To install Eyebrow you can do it either via NPM or Bower.

```
npm install eyebrow
```
or
```
bower install eyebrow
```

You can then import Eyebrow to your page using [Browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify) or a `<script>` tag.

## Brow(action, data)
The core of the framework is the `Brow` function.

### Brow()
When calling Brow with no arguments, it simply reloads and refreshes the current view.

### Brow(action, data)
When calling Brow with both parameters, there occur 4 different cases:

## Views


## Templating

## Routing

## Query Selector and miscellaneous
